# Predict-the-Batch-Performance-Hackathon
Input parameters are the sensors attached to a machine, which are 54 in number. In the dataset, they are named as x0, x1, x2 … x54. Since this is a batch manufacturing, a batch is of a certain time period, say t0 is the batch start and t6 is the batch end. Sensor values being recorded at time instance t0, t1, t2 … t6 are labeled as x0_t0, x0_t1, x0_t2 … x0_t6 respectively in the dataset, similarly for the others. All values are numerical (float or binary), there are no string or multiclass type features. All the sensors attached to the machine are physically independent although there can be statistical dependency present in their values. Then there is output parameter y2 which has to be considered independently. They describe the batch performance. Rows in the dataset represent batches. Row numbers are important as they are sorted time-wise. Although batches are considered independent to each other, you may find statistical dependency among them, hence you may convert this problem into a time series multivariate regression problem. It is completely your decision. Batch performance is related to the machine’s state which is being captured by those 54 sensors. Hence this problem can be modeled as a multivariate regression problem where you train a model by looking at the machine’s state and compute the batch performance.
Achieve the highest possible R2 score for label y2.
